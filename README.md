Hydra+ is a small interpreter language that can be compiled for Windows and Linux platforms.
As for now (05-01-2025) this repository hosts the Linux version of the source code , but when i have the 
time i will upload the windows version too. If you want to test the windows version , you can download a precompiled 
Hydra+ Interpreter at the deus-ex.gr/varius/hydra+.zip

Below i will explain the basic operation of the Hydra+ , why i create it and how you can compile the source code for Linux 
that this repository hosts (NOTE : The source code has precompiled some third party libraries for convinience , that limits the compile to x86-64bit systems that are Ubuntu based.
See the relevant informations in the compile section later in the text).

-- What is Hydra+ ? 
Hydra+ is a single executable (for windows is trully standalone as it has statically )
